## IBM Watson Workshop - Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik
In this workshop you will learn more about [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/products-services). You will get hands-on experience and build a spoken translator with the help of prebuilt AI services and Node-RED. Besides, you will get some insights into the life of a Data Scientist, see how AI models are created and what to consider: from data to models, from use cases to ethics. We are looking forward to meeting you!

### Hands-On
In the hands-on workshop, you will learn how to create a spoken translator with the aid of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and [IBM Watson products](https://www.ibm.com/watson/products-services).

#### Preparation
*Complete below steps in advance.*
1. Create a free [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)
1. Log in to your [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login)
3. Create a [Node-RED App](./node-red-cloud)


#### Exercises
*Work through below steps during the workshop (in small breakout sessions). Ask for help where needed.*
1. [Create the Watson AI service instances](./create-watson-services)
2. [Connect the Watson AI Services to the Node-RED App](./connect-watson-services)
3. Follow steps 5, 6, 7 from the [IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/) tutorial 
   - [Build a spoken universal translator using Node-RED and Watson AI services](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/tutorials/build-universal-translator-nodered-watson-ai-services/)
   - feel free to update the language settings such that your translator translates from "German" to the language of your choice
4. Experiment on your own. 
  - What other use-cases can you think of?
  - Are there other [prebuilt services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Alite%20label%3Aibm_created&category=ai#services) that could help?
